Directories are named after the agent that uses the files in them. See
`readers/directory_naming.txt` for more information.



Document readers will find material in the 'readers' directory.

As you are reading this you might be a GQL_to_Cypter-ologist.  Please read
documents in the ./ologist directory for project information, and the
documents in the developer/ologist directory for documents on building
the project.

The project top level is for project management and imported tools. Developers
do development work in the `developer` directory.

For developers, from the top of the project get started by typing:
```
> . executor/env_dev
``

This will setup the environment and `cd` to the developer directory.  (`env_dev`
is analogous to the Python virtual environment `activate`.)
