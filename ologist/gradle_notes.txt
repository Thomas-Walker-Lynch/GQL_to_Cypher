gradle

1. This is risky software.

  It searches for its files, thus traverses the directory tree.

  It access the internet for data.

  The installer downloads binaries from the site. It is not distributed as a repo
  with Fedora, Debian, or .. anything else.

  It has access to everyone's projects. Big honeypot.


2. Java

  Gradle is a Java program so it needs the JVM to run.  

  Gradle is being used to install most of the tools. 

    It does not install  Gradle of course.  There is a bash script for that.

    We assume that Gradle is using a version of Java on the system. But it will
    still install a specific version of Java required by the project build.
    `gradle.parameters` sets the version number for the build Java.  The build
    Java will be installed under the 'tools' directory.
