The work area for developers is the `developer` directory. All other subdirectories
and files found at the top level are for project management.

The best way to setup the environment and to enter the `developer` directory is
to use the `repo` command found in RT's `resource` project. The `repo` command
will start a new shell with the proper environment variables setup for the 
project, and nothing else.

A project can also be entered by sourcing `env_dev` by running the command
`. exector/env_dev` in a shell.  `use_tool` is analogous to `activate` in Python.
