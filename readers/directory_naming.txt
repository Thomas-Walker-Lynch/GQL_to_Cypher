Generally, project directories are named after the agent the files are for.

The top level directory is reserved for the project manager. The project
manager's directory will hold the git repo, virtual environment tool installs,
and one or more files to be sourced for initializing the environment.  The
environment variable $REPO_HOME points to the top level directory.

The developers' directory is $REPO_HOME/developer, which is the also
$DEVELOPER_HOME.

When 'make' or 'build.gradle' is found in the top level directory,
i.e. $REPO_HOME, it is for building tools. The developer will have a separate
build file under $DEVELOPER_HOME.

When a project has files for the C compiler, cc, are put in a directory called "cc".
Files for the java compiler, javac, are in the directory "javac". Etc.

An `executor` is a generic name for a program that runs a file. Example
executors include the OS loader for binary files, the JVM for .jar files,
and bash for running shell scripts.  A directory that holds a mix of such
files is called `executor`, as the files are for the `executor`.

A directory full of documents is then for 'readers'.

Some directories are more difficult to name after an agent that uses the
files in them. Like our ancestors who personified nearly everything with
spirits, we will do the same.

When programs use a directory as a scratch pad, where files will disappear
seemingly without reason we will call the directory "tanuki". This is a Japanese
raccoon so famous for making things disappear that it has taken on mystical
proportions.

As a developer I often have files that I set aside just in case I want to look
at them again, or later make new versions. So I give them to the God of sleep,
Somnus. Maybe they will be woken up, maybe they won't. Unlike tanuki files,
they are not deleted by any of the tools.

Files in tanuki and Soumnus are not placed into the repo.
