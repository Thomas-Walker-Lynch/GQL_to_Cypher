GQL_to_Cypher

Is a work in progress.

Is a program to translate GQL queries into Cypher queries.

An ANTLR grammar is used to make a parse tree from a GQL source file.  The
parse tree is then transformed into a form printable in Cypher.  A preface
is written followed by the print ot of the parse tree in Cypher.
