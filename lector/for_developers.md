The work area for developers is the `developer` directory. All other subdirectories
and files found at the top level are for project management.

Run `. development_init` in a shell to setup the development environment and to enter the
`development` directory.

`development_init` is analogous to `activate` in Python.

See the `resource` project for the `repo` command and additional tools for entering 
a directory and setting the bash prompt.
